The Last Journey is a large-volume, gravity-only, cosmological N-body simulation evolving more than 1.24 trillion particles in a periodic box with a side-length of 5.025Gpc. It was implemented using the HACC simulation and analysis framework on the BG/Q system, Mira. The cosmological parameters are chosen to be consistent with the results from the Planck satellite. A range of analysis tools have been run in situ to enable a diverse set of science projects, and at the same time, to keep the resulting data amount manageable. Analysis outputs have been generated starting at redshift $z \sim 10$ to allow for construction of synthetic galaxy catalogs using a semi-analytic modeling approach in post-processing. As part of our in situ analysis pipeline we employ a new method for tracking halo sub-structures, introducing the concept of subhalo cores. The production of multi-wavelength synthetic sky maps is facilitated by generating particle lightcones in situ, also beginning at $z \sim 10$. We provide an overview of the simulation set-up and the generated data products; a first set of analysis results is presented. A subset of the data is publicly available.
