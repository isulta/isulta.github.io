In this paper we introduce the Farpoint simulation, the latest member of the Hardware/Hybrid Accelerated Cosmology Code (HACC) gravity-only simulation family. The domain covers a volume of (1000$h^{-1}$Mpc)$^3$ and evolves close to two trillion particles, corresponding to a mass resolution of $m_p\sim 4.6\cdot 10^7 h^{-1}$M$_\odot$. These specifications enable comprehensive investigations of the galaxy-halo connection, capturing halos down to small masses. Further, the large volume resolves scales typical of modern surveys with good statistical coverage of high mass halos. The simulation was carried out on the GPU-accelerated system Summit, one of the fastest supercomputers currently available. We provide specifics about the Farpoint run and present an initial set of results. The high mass resolution facilitates precise measurements of important global statistics, such as the halo concentration-mass relation and the correlation function down to small scales. Selected subsets of the simulation data products are publicly available via the HACC Simulation Data Portal.
