This paper introduces Subhalo Mass-loss Analysis using Core Catalogs (SMACC). SMACC adds a mass model to substructure merger trees based on halo "core tracking." Our approach avoids the need for running expensive subhalo finding algorithms and instead uses subhalo mass-loss modeling to assign masses to halo cores. We present details of the SMACC methodology and demonstrate its excellent performance in describing halo substructure and its evolution. Validation of the approach is carried out using cosmological simulations at significantly different resolutions. We apply SMACC to the 1.24-trillion-particle Last Journey simulation and construct core catalogs with the additional mass information. These catalogs can be readily used as input to semianalytic models or subhalo abundance matching approaches to determine approximate galaxy distributions, as well as for in-depth studies of small-scale structure evolution.
