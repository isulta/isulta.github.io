I use simulations to study major open questions in astrophysics and cosmology (see [Why use simulations?](#why-use-simulations)).
I am currently a graduate researcher in the [Faucher-Giguère galaxy formation group](https://galaxies.northwestern.edu/) at the [Center for Interdisciplinary Exploration and Research in Astrophysics (CIERA)](https://ciera.northwestern.edu/) at Northwestern.

Here's a glance at my ongoing and recent research projects.

### Massive galaxy formation and AGN feedback

<sub>
Advised by Prof. Claude-André Faucher-Giguère, I am studying the formation of massive galaxies (more massive than the Milky Way) using cosmological hydrodynamical [FIRE (Feedback in Realistic Environments)](https://fire.northwestern.edu/) simulations, in order to examine major open problems related to their quenched star formation rates, supermassive black holes and the role of their feedback (i.e. active galactic nuclei feedback), and halo gas. The first set of results will be a comparison of the properties of gaseous massive halos (e.g. density, temperature, and pressure profiles) in simulations with X-ray and SZ (Sunyaev–Zeldovich) effect observations. FIRE simulations which include a variety of models of AGN feedback will be used.

### Modeling halo substructure in extreme-scale cosmology simulations

<sub>
Working as a post-bac student in the [Cosmological Physics and Advanced Computing (CPAC)](https://cpac.hep.anl.gov/) Group at Argonne National Laboratory and advised by Dr. Salman Habib and Dr. Katrin Heitmann, I helped develop Subhalo Mass-loss Analysis using Core Catalogs (SMACC), a new approach to tracking dark matter substructure that has several advantages over subhalo finding methods, which adds a mass model to halo merger trees in cosmological simulations using "core tracking." I implemented SMACC on the large-scale gravity-only Last Journey and Farpoint Simulations run at Argonne, and produced catalogs of proxy subhalos.
I have given several [talks](talks) about this project.
