I apply simulations to study open problems in astrophysics and cosmology.
I am currently a graduate researcher in the [Faucher-Gigu√®re galaxy formation group](https://galaxies.northwestern.edu/) at the [Center for Interdisciplinary Exploration and Research in Astrophysics (CIERA)](https://ciera.northwestern.edu/) at Northwestern.

Here's a glance at my ongoing and recent projects.
