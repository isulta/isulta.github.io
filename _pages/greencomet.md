There was a remarkable event to kick off 2023: comet C/2022 E3 (ZTF) visited the inner Solar System.
Amateur astronomers had the unique opportunity to photograph the "green comet" as it made its closest approach to Earth on around February 1. 
This set of images show the comet on Jan. 19- Feb. 17; they were acquired in northern Illinois and at remote observatories in the US and Europe.
